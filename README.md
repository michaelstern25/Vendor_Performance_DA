ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

âœ… 1. Top vs. Low Performing Vendors (Confidence Interval Analysis)

Using t-distribution-based confidence intervals, we compared Top Vendors and Low Vendors on profit margins.

Top Vendors showed a higher mean profit margin with narrower confidence intervals, indicating consistent performance.

Low Vendors had lower mean margins and wider intervals, showing more variability and potential issues in pricing or strategy.


âœ… 2. Promotional Opportunity: Low Sales, High Margin Brands

We identified brands with low total sales (bottom 15%) but high profit margins (top 15%) using scatter plots:

These brands are high-margin but underperforming in volume.

They are perfect candidates for marketing campaigns or pricing adjustments to drive growth without sacrificing profitability.


âœ… 3. Visualizations & Plots

Histogram with Confidence Intervals: Compared distributions of Top vs. Low vendors using KDE and CI bands.

Scatter Plot: Highlighted target brands for strategic focus using sales vs. profit margin mapping.

Threshold Lines: Added quantile-based cutoffs to clearly differentiate target groups.
